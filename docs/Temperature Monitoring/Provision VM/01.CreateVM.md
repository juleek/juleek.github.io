title: Create VM


Authenticate in Google Cloud --- `gcloud auth login`

You can set default project with `gcloud config set project project_name`, and unset it with `gcloud config unset project`.


??? info "Choose region and zone"

    **List regions along with available resources** --- `gcloud compute regions list --project project_name`

    **List zones** --- `gcloud compute zones list --project project_name`

    [**Region picker**](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/region-picker/) --- allows to pick the best region
    according to multiple metrics (compute price & latency).




Set default regions and zones for project:
```bash
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata                                                       \
    --metadata google-compute-default-region=region_name,google-compute-default-zone=zone_name \
    --project project_name
```



??? info "Choose image"

    **List images, families and image-projects** ---
    `gcloud compute images list --project project_name | grep -v -- "-arm64\|-pro-" | grep -i "PROJECT\|FAMILY\|ubuntu"`

    Pick "image project" and "image family".



??? info "Choose disk"

    Each VM instance has at least one disk attached to it. Each disk incurs a cost, described in this section.

    1. **List disk types** --- `gcloud compute disk-types list --filter="zone:( ezone_name )" --project project_name`
    2. [**Description of different disk types**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#disk-types)
       (such as `standard`, `balanced`, `ssd`, etc...).
    3. [**Disks pricing**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/disks-image-pricing#disk).




??? info "Choose instance configuration"

    1. [**Choose machine family and series**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) based on its
       capabilities (range of cores, CPU manufacturer, RAM, etc...). (1)
       {.annotate}

        1. N2D is good for confidential computing. `E2-standard` is good for cost. `E2-medium` is has even less
           cost, but with shared core & CPU bursting.

    2. [**Consider shared core & CPU bursting**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#e2-shared-core) (machine series `e2-micro`, `e2-small`, `e2-medium`).

    3. **Choose security features**:

        1. [Confidential computing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm)
           (machine series `N2D`).
        2. [Shielded VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/shielded-vm#linux)
           (secure boot, UEFI, TPM, Integrity monitoring).
            * [List of images with Shielded VM support](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts). If the image supports Shielded VM features,
              [the following line appears in the output of](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance#gcloud)
              ```
              gcloud compute images describe IMAGE_NAME --project=project_name
              type: UEFI_COMPATIBLE
              ```
            * Use these option during VM creation:
              `--shielded-integrity-monitoring`, `--shielded-secure-boot`, `--shielded-vtpm` to enable it.
              [Or this command](https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/modifying-shielded-vm) to enable
              Shielded VM features in already existing VM.

    4. **Check availability in chosen region** ---
       `gcloud compute machine-types list --filter="zone:( zone_name )" --project project_name`.

    5. **Take into account pricing**:

        1. [Pricing of machines, disks, GPUs, etc...](https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing)
        2. [Google Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator).
        3. Consider 1 & 3 year commitments.



[Create VM](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create):


```bash
gcloud compute instances create vm_name      \
    --image-family   image_family            \
    --image-project  image_project           \
    --boot-disk-size disk_size               \
    --boot-disk-type disk_type               \
    --machine-type   machine_type            \
    --shielded-integrity-monitoring          \
    --shielded-secure-boot                   \
    --project project_name
```

??? info "Other CRUD Doperations"

    * [Delete](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/deleting-instance): `gcloud compute instances delete vm_name`
    * [Stop](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#stop_a_vm): `gcloud compute instances stop vm_name`
    * [Start](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#starting_a_stopped_instance): `gcloud compute instances start vm_name`

    In case of encrypted disk:

    * Create encrytpted disk: add the following: `TODO` in the the create command above.
    * [Start](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance#start_a_vm_that_has_encrypted_disks):
    `gcloud compute instances start vm_name --csek-key-file ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`



[Create commitment](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/commitments/create):
```bash
gcloud compute commitments create commitment-1 \
    --plan=_-month                             \
    --resources=memory=_GB, vcpu=_             \
    --project project_name                     \
```
